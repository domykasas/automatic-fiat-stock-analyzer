## Automatic Fiat Stock Analyzer ("Fiat Trade Calculator")

A desktop GUI tool that automatically scans a broad list of popular U.S. stocks (S&P 500 subset + popular tech tickers) and ranks them by a simple 3-point criteria using options-implied data from Yahoo Finance.

### Key features
- **Automatic scan**: Analyzes ~100 widely traded tickers with one click
- **Live market data**: Pulls quotes, options chains, and volumes via `yfinance`
- **Options-driven metrics**:
  - **IV30/RV30** using Yang–Zhang realized volatility
  - **Term structure slope** between near and ~45 DTE expiries
  - **Expected move** from ATM straddle mid-price on the first considered expiry
- **Simple scoring (0–3)** and an at-a-glance recommendation label
- **Responsive UI** with progress bar and real-time console logs

### How scoring works (high level)
For each ticker:
- **Scored criteria (1 point each):**
  - **Volume filter**: 30D average volume ≥ 1,500,000
  - **Volatility premium**: IV30/RV30 ≥ 1.25 (RV via Yang–Zhang)
  - **Term structure**: Slope between earliest included expiry and ~45 DTE ≤ -0.00406
- **Informational (not scored):**
  - **Expected move**: Displayed when ATM straddle mid can be computed

Total score is the number of scored criteria met (0–3). "Expected move" does not affect the score. The UI maps score to a visual recommendation.

In simple terms:
- 3 points: Strong Buy (🔥)
- 2 points: Buy (✅)
- 1 point: Consider (⚠️)
- 0 points: Avoid (❌)

A stock earns 1 point for each check it passes: volume, IV vs RV, and term-structure slope.

### Requirements
- **Python**: 3.10–3.12 (NumPy 2.x and SciPy ≥ 1.15 require Python ≥ 3.10)
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Network access**: Required to reach Yahoo Finance and Wikipedia

Python dependencies (also in `requirements.txt`):
```
FreeSimpleGUI==5.1.1
numpy==2.1
scipy==1.15.1
yfinance==0.2.54
requests==2.31.0
```

### Install
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     python -m venv .venv
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run
```bash
python calculator.py
```
Then click "Start Auto Analysis". Keep the window open during analysis. Progress and helpful logs also appear in the terminal.

### Notes and data sources
- **Tickers**: Fetched from Wikipedia’s S&P 500 page when available; otherwise falls back to a built-in popular list
- **Options/quotes**: Pulled via `yfinance` from Yahoo Finance
- **Interpolation**: Linear spline over ATM IVs across expirations using SciPy
- **GUI**: Built with `FreeSimpleGUI`

### Troubleshooting
- **SciPy/NumPy install issues**: Ensure a 64-bit Python and an up-to-date `pip`/`setuptools`/`wheel`.
- **Rate limits or missing data**: Yahoo Finance may throttle. Re-run later or reduce frequency.
- **"No options found" / "Not enough option data"**: Some tickers or sessions won’t have chains or expiries meeting the ~45 DTE requirement.
- **Network/SSL errors**: Confirm internet connectivity and that corporate proxies/firewalls allow access to Yahoo/Wikipedia.
- **Emoji rendering**: If UI emojis look odd, it’s just a font/OS rendering quirk; functionality is unaffected.

### Limitations
- Uses end-user network and public sources; stability and coverage can vary
- Not all non-U.S. symbols are supported
- Results are heuristic and simplified; they may not reflect tradable liquidity or spreads
